Westwood Online API
===================

This is my reverse-engineered version of the Westwood Online DLL in plain C.

Allows Red Alert 3.03 to connect to WOL, create or join a room and start a game.

Missing features currently include:
 * Dll registration and unregistration (register original dll first)
 * Correctly handling more than one instance of any interface which is not
   probably needed as the games only initialize one instance per session
 * Class documentation
 * Developer documentation
 * Various hacks that are in the original wolapi.dll
