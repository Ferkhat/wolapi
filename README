Westwood Online API
===================

This is my reverse-engineered version of the Westwood Online DLL in plain C.

It doesn't yet do much but allows Red Alert 3.03 to login and logout.

Missing features currently include:
 * Dll registration and unregistration (register original dll first)
 * Actual networking
 * Correctly handling more than one instance of any interface which is not
   probably needed as the games only initialize one instance per session
 * Class documentation
 * Developer documentation

More information about the project is available at IRC:
